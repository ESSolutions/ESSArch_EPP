The Submission agreements data fields can only be viewed by clicking
the **view** button next to the SA dropdown.

IP to be received.

closing the profile form.

Receive
-------
To receive an IP it needs to be placed in an archive and a structure so that
the IP and its content is indexed can be found on the search page.
First select archive, then structure and last structure unit, which is
where we will find the IP in the search result tree structure.

When satisfied with submission agreement and profiles,
select an **Archive policy** and click **Receive**.
The process of receiving the IP is started and if more IPs are included a
receive window for the next IP will appear.
An IP can be skipped by clicking the **Skip**-button,
then the receive window for the next included IP will appear,
if there is one.
