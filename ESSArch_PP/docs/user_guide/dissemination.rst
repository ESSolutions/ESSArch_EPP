Click the DIP row in the list view and two filebrowsers will appear.
The first represents data in the current users personal workspace which
can be marked and added to the second filebrowser window by clicking **Add**.
The user can also create new folders in the DIP and remove added files/folders.

With the right permissions a user can see content in other users workspaces by
selecting user in the user dropdown in the toolbar of the first filebrowser.
