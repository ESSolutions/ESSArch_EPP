submission agreement.

IP. The submission agreement's data fields can be viewed by clicking the
**view** button next to the dropdown.

be received.  When satisfied with the edit, click **Save**.

closing the profile form.

Receive
-------
To receive an IP it needs to be placed in an archive and a structure so that
the IP and its content is indexed and can be found on the search page.
First select archive, then structure and last structure unit, which is
where we will find the IP in the search result tree structure.

When satisfied with the submission agreement and the profiles, select an
**Archive policy** and click **Receive**.  The process of receiving the IP is
started and if more IPs are included a window for the next IP will appear.
An IP can be skipped by clicking the **Skip**-button.
