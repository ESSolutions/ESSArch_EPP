IP Approval is the place of EPP where AIPs are before they are preserved.
The purpose of the Approval page is to check if he AIP is approved for
preservation to the archive.

When clicking a AIP in the Approval list view we see
a request form, which simply is a form for different actions on a AIP.
There are a couple of different types of request which are explained below
