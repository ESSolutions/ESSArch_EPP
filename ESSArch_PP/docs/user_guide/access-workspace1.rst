Access Workspace
****************

The Access Workspace is where the user can modify IPs both in the user
interface and access the files to use 3rd party tools.
Workspaces are private and can be different for each user.

IPs in the Access workspace can be used as/as part of a dissemination.
Once an IP has been fetched to the Access workspace, the content is available
in the filebrowser on the :ref:`dissemination page <dissemination>`
When an IP is done in the workspace it can be clicked and can be
**Preserved** right away or **Moved to ingest/approval**.


To preserve an IP click the IP's row in the list view table.
Select the **Preserve** option, enter a value in the **purpose** field
and click **Submit**.
The progress can be followed in the status bar of the IP and in the
:ref:`State view <user-interface-state-view>` for more detailed information.

list view table. Select the option **Move to approval**, enter a value in
the **purpose** field and click **Submit**.
