.. py:attribute:: EXPORT_FORMATS

   File formats available to export search results to:

   * CSV
   * PDF

.. http:get:: /search/

   Searches all archives the user has access to in their current organization.

   The response consists of two parts, ``hits`` and ``aggregations``. ``hits``
   contains the search results while ``aggregations`` contains statistics about
   how the results is split up in different groups. 

   Each result consists of the matched document and some information about why
   it was included in the results. The ``_score`` is a positive floating-point
   number that increases the more relevant a search result is to the query.
   The ``highlight`` is used to show the user which part of a value
   that matched the query.

   :query string q: The search keywords
   :query string archive: Which are archive to search in
   :query [string] extension: Which file extensions to include
   :query string type: Restrict results to a single type (e.g. archive, volume, document)
   :query string start_date: Restrict results to a start date (YYYY[-MM-DD])
   :query string end_date: Restrict results to an end date (YYYY[-MM-DD])
   :query int page: page number
   :query int page_size: number of results per page. Default: 10
   :query string export: Exports the results to a file, must be a value in :py:attr:`EXPORT_FORMATS`

   :status 400: :code:`start_date > end_date` or accessing objects outside of
      `max_result_window`_
   :status 404: invalid :code:`page`
